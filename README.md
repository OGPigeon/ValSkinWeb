# ValSkinWeb
# Background
At first, we wanted to make a program for looking at your skin shop in Valorant, but APIs got closed down, so we pivoted. I realized it's hard to show people what skins I have in the game, so I wanted to make a website that could house all the skins in Valroant with its effects and everything. There are no websites (to this date) that do what I have just described and are up to date. 
# Introduction
This website's main feature is to see the skins in Valorant and its different levels with video.
# How to use
1. Search for skin with autocomplete
2. Using categories to look for skins
# Screenshots
# Updates
Adding Valorant stats as a tab and also Valorant news/esports
# Refrences
Valroant API
